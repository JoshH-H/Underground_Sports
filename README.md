# Underground_Sports

Underground Sports is created as an educational product that teaches users about different niche sporting events around the world, allowing the ability to take part in a near accurate representations of the sports in digital form. 

Upon achieving gold in a sport, the user can progress forward. If the user struggles at a more difficult mini-game, it causes them to step away from the product and contemplate their struggle from an objective standpoint. This can be linked to “I lose, therefore I think” (Shuen-shing Lee, 2003) where he believed that the user’s goal is defined to a specific end or win-state. When they lose, they’re able to critically evaluate how they lost and come up with new methods and avoid the same outcome.

# Inspiration

When researching other sport-related games, Winter Challenge (Accolade, 1991) inspired the UI art style of Underground Sports. Its simplistic design helped push a responsive and non-obstructive layout. Underground Sports will draw inspiration from these past games and develop a user experience that is efficient and easy to understand.
